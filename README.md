## Usage

The user is taken to the homepage where they can view existing posts, if they wish to create posts or comment on posts, they must log in. A user can sign up with a username, email, and password. The info is saved and can be used in another session to log in. Once logged in the user can access their dashboard where they can create posts, edit their posts, and delete them. When they access an existing post in the homepage, then they can comment on the post. Once submitted, the comment will appear under the post. The user can logout through the navigation, or if they are idle for more than 5 minutes, they are automatically logged out with an alert prompting the user to sign in again.
